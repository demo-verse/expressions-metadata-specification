# An NFT metadata specification for Expressions of Peace

This will be an observable process; where NFTs help build peer-to-peer consensus on peace-making. 

We'll be writing/declaring a future on blockchain, from now.

Here's the vision for a civilisation:

This metadata is an illustrative one, just to achieve a flow of peace, by and for billions and beyond. Bring your plan up, and use this if you need to start from somewhere, hopefully inspiring.


Initiated an illustrative metadata for Expression of Peace / EoP; 
https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-metadata-standard/blob/main/metadata/expression_of_peace.json

One ERC721 example of EoP, as in Disruptive Quote, deployed to Rinkeby testnet:

In the near future, an off-chain solution will be developed with holochain https://holochain.org for collaborative and private editing/expressing together. For persistence layer, IPFS/Filecoin will be useful. 

Might be including Lens protocol to create a twitter-like interaction adoption, facilitating engagement between peers. In that case,  It'll follow the protocol and deploy an app on Polygon network.

https://github.com/aave/lens-protocol/blob/main/contracts/libraries/DataTypes.sol

we'll transform Publish type and reflect Expressions, Acknowledgements, etc. via those interactions accordingly:

```
enum PubType {
        Expression,
        Acknowledgement,
        Reflection,
        Retired
    } 
    
//to this


    enum PubType {
        Post,
        Comment,
        Mirror,
        Nonexistent
    }

```

We might just start multiple projects around implementation/prototyping of the flows and see which side better evolves. 

It might be the case that, we have multiple projects co-existing in multiple networks and ecosystems. 

Expressions' NFTs most probably will not be transferrable,  nor something of use like everyday or weeks.
They are part of our decentralised ids/DIDs that build up in time. That's why minting of them will be convenient, and minters of those are also entitled to mint a tradeable version if they wanted. 

However, there'll be many kinds of NFTs that can be transferred. Such as, Disruptive Quotes and artworks dedicated to Peace Libary. 
Some are already minted as ERC721 and ERC1155/Packs on xDAI:

In the second half of this year on, will be incorporating with KILT protocol on incentivising, especially attestation state.
https://dev.kilt.io/docs/sdk/workshop/attestation 

Supplementing the flow, we'll soon create claimTypes/cTypes for Expressions/Acknowledgements.

>> Expressions

```
Expressions of/for Peace and Demand; are designed as facilitating a future-driven peer-to-peer diplomacy, via consensus contracts with peace making capacity by design.

They have types and scales, as attributes included; a single document as well can contain expressions 

peer-to-peer:

people-to-people
org-2-people-2-org 
org-to-org,
